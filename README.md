# Assignment 1 Favorite Song

This project will show you how to run a python file that outputs one of my favorite songs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will run this code on your local machine for printing all the lines from the Assignment1.py script.

### Prerequisites

Assignment1.py requires PyCharm Community Edition to run. You can download PyCharm Community Edition from the link below.

```
https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows
```

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command

```
play_song()
```
This will run the code and print out all the lyrics to the song.

## Thanks
Thank you for checking out my code. I hope you enjoy it and can also enjoy the song lyrics. I couldn't have done it without the wonderful instructors in the CNE program at Renton Technical College!
